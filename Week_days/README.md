# Enum Week Days

## Project Overview
The **Enum Week Days** is a Java web application designed to use an enum to represent the days of the week and display them using a loop.This project was meant to use an enum with inheritance (which enums in Java do not directly support). So, instead an abstract class or interface with an enum implementing it was used. However, since enum implicitly extends java.lang.Enum, it cannot extend another class.
